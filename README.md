LongCut is a fork of [Concat](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat), the free and
open-source video editor by Jareer and the Concat contributors. It is not
Concat and is not made or endorsed by its authors; see [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md).
Everything below that it shares with Concat comes from their work.

What LongCut adds is **Long video** (File ▸ Long video): describe an idea and
pick a length, and Claude writes the script chapter by chapter, the narration
and the shots are made (Concat's own voices or ElevenLabs; Replicate's video
models, draft colour cards, or shots made by hand), and the whole thing is cut
on a new timeline - shots fitted to the narration, transitions, captions,
chapter titles, a music bed - ready to edit and export like anything else.
See `src/crates/concat-generate`.

## About

Like Concat, LongCut is a free, open-source video editor and a CapCut alternative for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android. It covers what people actually open CapCut for: auto-captions, text-to-speech, background removal, keyframe animation, effects and titles, multi-track cutting, 4K export. With none of the catches: no watermark, no account, no subscription, no upload.

Everything runs locally on a native Rust engine with a GPU compositor. Install it, drop in footage, cut. The AI models for captions, voices and cutout download once from Settings and work offline after that. Your footage never leaves your disk.

**Good for:** TikTok, Reels and Shorts, YouTube videos, tutorials and screen recordings, podcast clips, memes.

**Also for machines:** a JSON-RPC API, so scripts and AI agents can cut video with it too.

## Highlights

- 🚫 **No watermarks. No account. No paywall.** Ever.
- 🔒 **100% local.** Nothing uploads. Works offline.
- 💬 **Auto-captions.** Local Whisper. Pick a model size, get styled captions on the timeline.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-speech + voice cloning.** Free local voices, or any voice from a few seconds of a recording.
- 🧍 **Background removal.** People, objects, or paint the mask yourself.
- 🎞️ **Keyframes.** Position, scale, rotation, opacity, volume, effect parameters. Curve editor built in.
- ✨ **100 effects, filters and transitions.** GPU-rendered, live in the preview.
- ✂️ **Cut fast.** Split, trim, ripple, merge, freeze frame, speed. Magnetic timeline if you want it.
- 🎚️ **Multi-track, multi-timeline.** Several cuts in one project. Blend modes, crop, flips.
- 📝 **Titles.** Fonts, stroke, shadow, background plate. Presets to start from.
- 🎙️ **One-switch voice cleanup.** Denoise, enhance voice, level the loudness. Plus chipmunk, robot, telephone and friends.
- 📤 **Export.** H.264, HEVC, AV1. Up to 4K 60, 10-bit colour.
- 🦀 **Native Rust engine.** GPU compositor, proxies, hardware decode. 4K scrubs smoothly.
- 🤖 **Scriptable.** A JSON-RPC API that scripts and AI agents can cut video with. A build from source adds gRPC and a command-line tool.
- 🖥️ **macOS, Windows, Linux, Android.** 25 languages. Same app, same project files.

## Download

Two ways in:

1. **[The website](https://concatenate.pages.dev/#download)** hands you the right build for your machine. Start here.
2. **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/releases)** has every build for every platform, with installers, packages and checksums. For when you want to pick.

Concat is in **beta**: it works, and it still has edges. [Say so](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/issues) when you find one.

**Platforms**

- ✅ **Windows** · x86_64 (ARM builds are paused, see [#326](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/issues/326)). A setup and an `.msi`. If SmartScreen stops an unsigned build: **More info** › **Run anyway**
- ✅ **macOS** · Intel and Apple silicon. If macOS refuses to open an unsigned build: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Concat.app`
- ✅ **Linux** · x86_64 and ARM. `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and an Arch package. Also a Flatpak on **[Flatpark](https://flatpark.org/apps/app.concat.editor/)**, a community Flatpak remote that wraps the x86_64 `.deb` of each release and updates with it
- ✅ **Android** · phones and tablets
- ✅ **iOS / iPadOS** · iPhone and iPad, sideloaded

✅ Supported · 🚧 Work in progress · 🧪 To be tested

**System requirements** and the optional model sizes are on [the website](https://concatenate.pages.dev/guides/system-requirements).

**[Code signing policy](CODE_SIGNING.md)**: why the Windows builds are not signed yet, and what Concat sends over the network (nothing you did not ask for).

## Build from source

You need Rust 1.93 or newer (see `rust-version` in `src/Cargo.toml`), the FFmpeg 7+ development libraries, cmake and a C++ compiler.

- **macOS:** `brew install ffmpeg`
- **Windows:** from [FFmpeg's Windows downloads](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows), take BtbN's `win64-gpl-shared` build (the one CI uses), unpack it and point `FFMPEG_DIR` at it
- **Linux:** use your distro's FFmpeg if it is version 7 or newer, otherwise use a BtbN `shared` build with `FFMPEG_DIR` like on Windows

Then:

```sh
cd src
cargo run -p concat          # the editor window
```

Other useful commands:

```sh
cargo build --profile app -p concat   # the shipping binary (fat LTO, stripped)
cargo test                            # run the test suite
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # what CI checks
```

If you change text the interface shows, run `python3 scripts/locales.py` from the repo root so the string inventory stays in sync. Full details live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to Contribute

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The best way to contribute is to grab a build from the [Releases](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/releases) page and use it: find where it breaks, and say where it could be better.
>
> Ready to write code? [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) covers setup, the layout of the tree, the checks to run, and how contributions are licensed. Driving Concat from a script, a service or an agent? [The developer docs](https://concatenate.pages.dev/docs) cover the Concat API and its transports: JSON-RPC and gRPC. [This Discussion](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/discussions/3) is where the project was announced.

> Contributors can claim a `@Contributor` role in the Discord server: just ask.
